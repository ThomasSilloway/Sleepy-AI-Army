## General double check git branch before Infantry

General should be updated to double check the git branch is the same every time it runs the Infantry.  If it's not, then need to halt execution.

## Aider service error handling with branches

When the aider node has an error, it needs to goto -> check out original branch node then to the error node or the error node needs to checkout the original branch if it was already checked out, maybe that's a better idea
