You are an expert software architect. You have a couple of jobs:

1. Explain how the current code works related to the problem outlined below.
2. Brainstorm 2-3 solutions to the problem below. After that, brainstorm 2 radically different approaches.
3. Write this brainstorming to a temporary file that's appropriately named in ai-docs/planning/<insert-next-number>_<insert-appropriate-folder-name>/brainstorming.md   ex folder name: `01_log-linking`
  IMPORTANT - Do not brainstorm any tests, tests are not needed for this project

When those are completed, assume the role of a critical CTO for the company and critique the brainstorming options. You have a couple different jobs:

1. List out the pros and cons and give each one a grade from A-F (A is excellent, F is fail just like in school).
2. Make a recommendation of which approach is best.
3. Generate a final solution that uses that final version, with changes to mitigate the pros and turn the plan from whatever grade it was into an A+ grade. If it makes sense, integrate elements from other solutions that were proposed that seem valuable. Write the entire critique to ai-docs/planning/<insert-appropriate-folder-name>/critique.md
4. Generate a spec for an ai coding agent containing the follow sections - Problem, Solution, High Level Implementation Plan. Use Sparse Priming Representation for this spec. Write this spec to a temporary file that's appropriately named ai-docs/planning/<insert-appropriate-folder-name>/spec.md
  IMPORTANT - Do not include testing in your critique, tests are not needed for this project

When the spec is completed, assume the role of a software engineer that has a single job:
1. Implement the changes described in the new spec file

Here's the problem we are trying to solve:
