Assume the role of a critical CTO for the company and critique the files for the working directory. You have a couple different jobs:

1. List out the good and bad of the working directory and give a grade from A-F (A is excellent, F is fail just like in school).
2. Make recommendations on how to improve the code to with changes to mitigate the bad while keeping the good and turn the code from whatever grade it was into an A+ grade.
4. Generate a spec for an ai coding agent containing the follow sections for each aspect of the changes - Problem, Solution, High Level Implementation Plan. Use Sparse Priming Representation for this spec. So there should be multiple Problem/Solution/High Level Implementation Plan sections, one for each aspect of the changes in this document. The spec should be put into the working directory in the directory `ai-docs\specs\XX-short-description` where `XX` is the next number in the sequence and `short-description` is a short description of the spec.

Then:

Assume the role of an expert software engineer and implement the changes from the spec.
