General Instructions:
 - Adhere to the coding conventions in `ai-docs\CONVENTIONS.md`
 - If unsure about code to write, implement to the best of your ability making assumptions where necessary. There is no need to add comments with different implementation options, I am going to delete them anyways.

Working Directory: `army-infantry`

Status:

- Added the file scaffolding for the army-infantry folder. 
- Implemented - Graph builder and graph state
- Implemented - `army-infantry\src\nodes\initialize_mission\node.py`

Task to Implement:

The other langraph nodes need to be updated to match the format of `army-infantry\src\nodes\initialize_mission\node.py`
Only implement the main node function and then the initial private function with a stub and a log in it
