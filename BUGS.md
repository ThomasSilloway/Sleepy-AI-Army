## Failed to parse aider output - fixed root cause, but improvement could be made

### Questions

- Why did it fail? The output looks like valid json to me.  Oh maybe bc it didn't include the total cost yet? Confirmed - total cost wasn't there, it works now though.  Still should do this below:
- Even if it fails to parse in the correct format, we should consider making our own and set the raw output summary to the entire output of response from the LLM.

## When a commit isn't made, sometimes the STDERR is not helpful

### Example manifest

```
# Update changelog with total aider cost
Update `army-man-small-tweak\src\nodes\manifest_update.py` to use the `total_aider_cost` from `WorkflowState` to update the `changelog` with the total cost of the aider run if the aider run was successful.

## Overall Status
Failed

## Current Focus
Update `army-man-small-tweak\src\nodes\manifest_update.py` to use the `total_aider_cost` from `WorkflowState` to update the `changelog` with the total cost of the aider run if the aider run was successful.

 - Error details: [SmallTweakExecution] Error: Failed to parse aider summary
Aider STDERR (first 500 chars): 

## Human Responses
NONE

Last Update: 2025-06-01 09:33 PM
```

### Fixes

 - Update it so Aider STDERR won't be printed if it's empty
 - Update it so the error details will include the raw aider output summary if the std error is empty
 - Also add some logging of the last 10 lines of aider output to the manifest
 - Add a newline between the error details and the aider stderr log

### Repro case:

 - Remove the `total_cost` and other fields from `get_summary()` in `aider_service.py`

## Multiple aider commits likely not logged in the changelog

I don't think we added support for that and it is possible for multiple commits by aider
