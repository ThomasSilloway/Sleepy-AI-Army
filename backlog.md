## Design Database Schema for User Profiles
Detailed description:
The first step is to design the database schema. This should include tables for user profiles, considering fields like user_id, username, email, password_hash, creation_date, and last_login.
- Consider data types for each field.
- Define primary and foreign keys if necessary for future relations.
- Document the schema.

## Develop API Endpoints for User Authentication
Detailed description:
Next, develop the API endpoints required for user authentication. This will involve creating endpoints for:
- User registration (`/auth/register`)
- User login (`/auth/login`)
- User logout (`/auth/logout`, if session management is implemented)
- Potentially a password reset request endpoint.
Ensure all endpoints handle request validation and appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Implement Frontend User Login UI
Detailed description:
Create the frontend components for the user login page and registration form.
- The login page should have fields for email/username and password.
- The registration form should collect necessary user details.
- Implement form validation on the client-side.
- Style the forms for a clean user experience.

## Write Unit Tests for Authentication Service
Detailed description:
Thoroughly test the authentication service logic.
- Write unit tests for user registration success and failure cases.
- Write unit tests for login with correct and incorrect credentials.
- Mock any external dependencies like database calls.
```
