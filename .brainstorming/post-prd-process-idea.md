# Report: Proposed AI-Assisted Workflow for Post-PRD Design

**Date:** May 3, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a proposed structured workflow for progressing from a finalized Product Requirements Document (PRD) to a comprehensive Technical Architecture Document, ready for implementation. This workflow utilizes a sequence of specialized AI agents (or distinct phases in a manual process) to ensure thorough analysis, exploration of options, detailed design, and consideration of critical factors. It consolidates standard software architecture practices into a practical, multi-stage process suitable for AI assistance or guiding manual efforts.

## 2. Prerequisite

* A finalized **Level 1 Product Requirements Document (`PRD`)**. This document defines the *"what"* and *"why"* of the project, focusing on user needs, goals, functional requirements (externally observable), key NFRs, and constraints, while avoiding deep implementation details.

## 3. Proposed Workflow Stages (Post-PRD)

The workflow consists of four main stages, each potentially handled by a dedicated AI agent or representing a distinct phase of manual work.

### Stage 1: Architecture Options Analysis

* **Agent Role:** `Architecture Options Analyst`
* **Goal:** To explore different viable ways to implement the requirements outlined in the PRD and analyze their trade-offs.
* **Primary Input:** Finalized `PRD`.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Analyze `PRD`: *Thoroughly* review requirements, NFRs, and constraints.
    * Initial Feasibility Assessment: Briefly evaluate the overall technical feasibility.
    * Brainstorm Approaches: Generate 2-3 distinct high-level architectural approaches/patterns (incorporating Step 3 from the detailed process).
    * For Each Approach:
        * Outline key conceptual components and interactions.
        * Define core Interface Ideas (addressing Step 4).
        * Suggest potential Technology Categories or types relevant to the approach.
        * Perform an Initial Risk Assessment identifying challenges specific to the approach (addressing part of Step 8).
        * Evaluate Pros & Cons based on `PRD` (especially NFRs), feasibility, complexity, etc.
* **Primary Output:** `"Brainstormed Architecture Options"` document (`Markdown` recommended) comparing the approaches.

> **(>>> HUMAN DECISION POINT <<<)**
> * The developer/architect reviews the `"Brainstormed Architecture Options"` document.
> * A preferred architectural approach is selected based on the analysis.

### Stage 2: Core Detailed Design

* **Agent Role:** `Core Technical Designer`
* **Goal:** To flesh out the core technical details of the chosen architectural approach.
* **Primary Input(s):** Finalized `PRD`, Chosen Architectural Approach (from Stage 1 output/decision).
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Refine Chosen Approach: Solidify the high-level structure based on the selected option.
    * Technology Selection & Justification: Make specific technology choices (frameworks, libraries, services etc.) consistent with the approach and justify them (addressing Step 5).
    * Interface Definition: Finalize key APIs, data contracts, or file formats required for component interaction (finalizing Step 4).
    * Key Component Design: Detail the responsibilities, core logic (described textually), and interactions of major components or modules within the chosen architecture (addressing Step 6).
* **Primary Output:** `"Core Design Document"` (`Markdown` recommended) detailing interfaces, tech stack, and component designs.

### Stage 3: Supporting Plans & Strategies

* **Agent Role:** `NFR & Deployment Strategist`
* **Goal:** To detail how the core design addresses critical operational aspects and non-functional requirements.
* **Primary Input(s):** Finalized `PRD`, `"Core Design Document"` (from Stage 2).
* **Key Tasks:**
    * NFR Fulfillment Strategy: Detail how the Core Design *specifically* addresses key Non-Functional Requirements from the `PRD` (e.g., scalability mechanisms, security considerations, performance optimizations) (addressing Step 7).
    * Deployment & Infrastructure Outline: Describe the high-level deployment strategy, target environment(s), and key infrastructure considerations (addressing Step 9).
    * Final Risk Assessment: Conduct a more detailed risk assessment based on the finalized Core Design and NFR/Deployment plans, suggesting mitigations (addressing final part of Step 8).
* **Primary Output:** `"Supporting Plans Document"` (`Markdown` recommended) covering NFR Strategy, Deployment Outline, and Final Risk Assessment.

### Stage 4: Documentation Finalization

* **Agent Role:** `Documentation Consolidator`
* **Goal:** To synthesize all preceding design information into a single, comprehensive technical blueprint.
* **Primary Input(s):** `PRD`, `"Core Design Document"` (Stage 2), `"Supporting Plans Document"` (Stage 3). Potentially the `"Brainstormed Options Doc"` for context.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Consolidate Information: Merge and organize the information from the Core Design and Supporting Plans into a coherent structure.
    * Define Folder & File Structure: Propose a logical organization for the project's codebase and key directories.
    * Describe Key Diagrams (Textually): Outline the necessary diagrams (e.g., Component, Sequence, Deployment) by describing their elements and relationships in text, suitable for manual creation or input to a diagramming tool/agent.
    * Final Review & Formatting: Ensure consistency, clarity, and completeness.
* **Primary Output:** `"Final Technical Architecture Document"` (`Markdown` recommended).

## 4. Applicability

This workflow provides a structured approach suitable for:

* Guiding manual software design efforts after requirements gathering.
* Serving as a specification for configuring an automated multi-agent system (like the Sleepy AI Army) to handle post-PRD design phases.

The level of detail generated by each agent/stage can be adjusted based on project complexity.
