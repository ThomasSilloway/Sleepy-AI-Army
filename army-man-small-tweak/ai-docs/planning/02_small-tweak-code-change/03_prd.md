# Product Requirements Document: PoC7 (LangGraph Orchestration - Phase 2: Automated Task Execution)

**Version:** 1.0-PoC7-Phase2
**Date:** 2025-05-14

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Level 1 requirements for the second phase of Proof-of-Concept 7 (PoC7). Building upon the initial phase which validated document scaffolding, this phase aims to demonstrate LangGraph's capability to orchestrate an AI-assisted tool to perform a defined file modification task (a "Small Tweak") and subsequently update the relevant tracking documentation. This phase is critical for proving the system's ability to manage and execute automated development work, further validating LangGraph as a core technology for the "Sleepy Dev Team" project. This document defines the "What" and "Why" of these capabilities.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

* **Primary Goal:** To validate LangGraph's capability to orchestrate an AI-assisted tool to automatically execute a predefined file modification task and accurately update the central goal record.
* **Objective 1:** Demonstrate the system's ability to interpret a task description and use an integrated AI-assisted tool to perform a specified file modification.
* **Objective 2:** Demonstrate the system's ability to update the central goal record (manifest) to accurately reflect the outcome of the automated task execution, including any changes made and versioning information.
* **Objective 3:** Ensure the entire process provides clear observability through console output and any existing logging/observability solutions.
* **Objective 4 (User Learning):** Provide further hands-on experience with LangGraph for sequencing more complex actions, managing state related to task execution, and handling outcomes from AI tool interactions.

## 3. Target Audience / User Personas

* **Primary User:** The developer initiating the PoC script, providing the initial configuration and task description, and observing the system's output (console, modified files, updated goal record) to validate the successful orchestration and execution of the automated task.

## 4. Functional Requirements

This second phase of PoC7 involves extending the LangGraph-orchestrated workflow to include automated task execution and subsequent record updating.

### FR-PoC7-P2-001: Automated Task Performance

* **Description:** The system, orchestrated by LangGraph, will automatically perform a defined small task involving a file modification using an integrated AI-assisted tool.
* **Input Preconditions (building on Phase 1):**
    * The system has successfully initialized (as per Phase 1).
    * Initial records about the goal (e.g., a central goal record/manifest) are in place.
    * A clear description of a specific, simple file modification task is available.
* **Process (Level 1 - Observable):**
    1. LangGraph initiates the task execution step.
    2. The system reads and understands the defined small task from its description.
    3. The system instructs an integrated AI-assisted tool to perform the required file modification.
    4. If the task is completed successfully, the changes to the file are saved and versioned (e.g., via a git commit).
* **Output:** A modified project file, with changes versioned.

### FR-PoC7-P2-002: Updating Central Goal Record After Task Execution

* **Description:** Following the automated task performance, the system will update the central goal record to reflect the outcome.
* **Process (Level 1 - Observable):**
    1. LangGraph initiates the goal record update step, using state/context from the task execution step (e.g., success status, path of modified file, versioning information).
    2. The system instructs an integrated AI-assisted tool (or uses direct file manipulation logic if appropriate for this specific record) to update the central goal record.
    3. The update will include the outcome of the task (success/failure), details of what was changed, and any relevant versioning information.
* **Output:** An updated central goal record reflecting the automated task's execution.

### FR-PoC7-P2-003: Error Handling (General)

* **Description:** The system must handle typical, high-level errors gracefully during the new operational steps.
* **Observable Behavior:** If a significant error occurs during task execution or record updating (e.g., AI tool fails to perform modification, cannot write to goal record), the process should stop the current task's progression and provide a clear error message to the user (e.g., via console output and observability system).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-PoC7-P2-001: Correctness:** The automated file modification must accurately reflect the instructions in the task description. The central goal record updates must accurately reflect the outcome of this modification.
* **NFR-PoC7-P2-002: Traceability & Observability:**
    * The system must stream relevant operational output (or a significant summary) from the AI-assisted tool and workflow steps to the console during execution.
    * The system must allow for visibility into high-level workflow steps, including the new task execution and record update steps, and enable drill-down into specific logs.
* **NFR-PoC7-P2-003: Modularity (LangGraph Design Goal):** The internal LangGraph design should aim for the automated task execution and the subsequent goal record update to be implemented as distinct, logically separated components/nodes within the graph.

## 6. Constraints

* **C-PoC7-P2-001: Must use LangGraph:** LangGraph must be the primary orchestrator for the defined workflow.
* **C-PoC7-P2-002: Must use an AI-assisted tool for Task Performance:** An AI-assisted tool (e.g., `aider`) must be used for the automated file modification. The same or another tool may be used for updating the goal record.
* **C-PoC7-P2-003: `uv` for Execution Environment:** The PoC will be run as a Python script within an environment managed by `uv`.

## 7. Data Requirements (Level 1)

* **Input Data:**
    * Path to the target "goal folder."
    * A task description file within the goal folder, detailing the specific file modification.
    * The existing central goal record (manifest) file.
* **Output Data:**
    * The modified project file within the goal folder.
    * The updated central goal record (manifest) file.
    * Real-time workflow and AI tool output streamed to the console.
    * Observability into high-level workflow steps and detailed logs.
    * Console messages indicating overall success or failure of the automated task execution.

## 8. Success Metrics (Phase 2)

* Successful modification of the target project file as per the task description, performed by the AI-assisted tool.
* Successful versioning (e.g., git commit) of the file modification.
* Successful update of the central goal record, accurately reflecting the task's outcome and changes made.
* Relevant output from the AI-assisted tool and workflow is streamed to the console during operation.
* Both high-level and detailed logs for the new steps are accessible for observability.
* The system correctly handles basic error conditions during task execution or record updates by reporting an error.
* The LangGraph orchestration successfully sequences the new steps and manages necessary context between them.
