My critique process confirmed that renaming `control.py` to `finalization_nodes.py` improves readability and removing the `tests/` directory aligns with the prototype's scope. Minor refinements include adding a bit more detail to the role of `finalization_nodes.py` in the Key Points and noting the implication of no tests on the README.

Here is the revised Section 8:

### **8. Proposed Folder and File Structure**

The proposed project structure is designed for clarity, modularity, and adherence to standard Python project layouts. It facilitates ease of navigation, development, and future scalability for this Proof-of-Concept.

```

**Key Points Explaining the Structure:**

* **Project Root (`poc7_langgraph_orchestrator/`):** This is the top-level directory containing all project-related files and directories.
* **`src/poc7_orchestrator/`**: The primary Python source package for the application. Using a `src` layout is a common practice that helps separate installable package code from other project files.
    * **`main.py`**: Serves as the main entry point for the PoC application, responsible for initializing components, defining the LangGraph graph, and starting the workflow.
    * **`config.py` & `state.py`**: Define the core Pydantic model (`AppConfig`) for static configuration and the `TypedDict` (`WorkflowState`) for dynamic graph state, respectively.
    * **`constants.py`**: Intended for truly fixed, internal constants used across the application, such as `LOG_SUBDIRECTORY_NAME = "logs"`. Configurable parameters are managed via `AppConfig` and `config.yml`.
    * **`nodes/`**: This package organizes the logic for each distinct LangGraph node into separate Python modules. The `finalization_nodes.py` module, for example, contains logic for nodes like `success_node` and `error_handler_node` which manage the graph's terminal states and log final outcomes.
    * **`services/`**: This package contains classes that encapsulate interactions with external tools or provide focused business capabilities (e.g., `AiderService`, `ChangelogService`).
    * **`utils/`**: This package is for shared utility functions or classes, such as the `logging_setup.py` module, which would contain the detailed logic for configuring the Python `logging` system based on `AppConfig`.
* **Configuration (`config.yml`):** Located at the project root. This file is external to the Python source code, allowing for easy modification of runtime parameters (like paths) without code changes.
* **Example Directories (`goal_examples/`, `workspace_examples/`):** These directories are **not** part of the packaged application code but are provided within the project repository for illustrative and documentation purposes. They demonstrate the expected directory structure and type of content for paths specified in `config.yml` (for `goal_root_path` and `workspace_root_path`) during an actual run. The files listed within (e.g., `task-description.md`, template files, and the illustrative output files like `goal-manifest.md`) show how inputs are structured and where outputs would typically be generated.
* **Testing:** For this prototype phase, dedicated automated testing infrastructure (such as a `tests/` directory) is explicitly omitted to maintain focus on core functionality. The `README.md` would reflect this scope by not detailing a testing strategy.
* **Project Management Files:**
    * `pyproject.toml`: Standard file for specifying project metadata, dependencies (for `uv`), and build system information.
    * `uv.lock`: Ensures reproducible Python environments by locking the exact versions of all dependencies.
    * `README.md`: Provides essential information for developers and users about the project, how to set it up, and how to run it.
* **Virtual Environment (`.venv/`):** Automatically managed by `uv` to isolate project dependencies. Typically added to `.gitignore`.
