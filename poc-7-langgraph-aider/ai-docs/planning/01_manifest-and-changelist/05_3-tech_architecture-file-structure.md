Here is the revised Section 8:

### **8. Proposed Folder and File Structure**

The proposed project structure is designed for clarity, modularity, and adherence to standard Python project layouts. It facilitates ease of navigation, development, and future scalability for this Proof-of-Concept.

**Key Points Explaining the Structure:**

* **Project Root (`poc-7-langgraph_aider/`):** This is the top-level directory containing all project-related files and directories.
* **`src/`**: The primary Python source package for the application. Using a `src` layout is a common practice that helps separate installable package code from other project files.
    * **`main.py`**: Serves as the main entry point for the PoC application, responsible for initializing components and starting the workflow.
    * **`graph_builder.py`**: Contains the logic for defining the LangGraph graph structure, including nodes and edges.
    * **`config.py` & `state.py`**: Define the core Pydantic model (`AppConfig`) for static configuration and the `TypedDict` (`WorkflowState`) for dynamic graph state, respectively.
    * **`constants.py`**: Intended for truly fixed, internal constants used across the application, such as `LOG_SUBDIRECTORY_NAME = "logs"`. Configurable parameters are managed via `AppConfig` and `config.yml`.
    * **`nodes/`**: This package organizes the logic for each distinct LangGraph node into separate Python modules. The `finalization_nodes.py` module, for example, contains logic for nodes like `success_node` and `error_handler_node` which manage the graph's terminal states and log final outcomes.
    * **`services/`**: This package contains classes that encapsulate interactions with external tools or provide focused business capabilities (e.g., `AiderService`, `ChangelogService`).
    * **`utils/`**: This package is for shared utility functions or classes, such as the `logging_setup.py` module, which would contain the detailed logic for configuring the Python `logging` system based on `AppConfig`.
* **Configuration (`config.yml`):** Located at the project root. This file is external to the Python source code, allowing for easy modification of runtime parameters (like paths) without code changes.
* **Project Management Files:**
    * `pyproject.toml`: Standard file for specifying project metadata, dependencies (for `uv`), and build system information.
    * `uv.lock`: Ensures reproducible Python environments by locking the exact versions of all dependencies.
    * `README.md`: Provides essential information for developers and users about the project, how to set it up, and how to run it.
* **Virtual Environment (`.venv/`):** Automatically managed by `uv` to isolate project dependencies. Typically added to `.gitignore`.
