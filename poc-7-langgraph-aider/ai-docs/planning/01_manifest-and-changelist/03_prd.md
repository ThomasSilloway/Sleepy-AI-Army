# Product Requirements Document: PoC7 (LangGraph Orchestration - Initial Phase)

**Version:** 1.0-PoC7
**Date:** 2025-05-08

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Level 1 requirements for the initial phase of Proof-of-Concept 7 (PoC7). This PoC aims to validate the fundamental viability of using LangGraph as an orchestrator for the "Sleepy Dev Team" project by demonstrating its ability to manage a stateful, multi-step workflow. Specifically, this initial phase focuses on LangGraph orchestrating the `aider` tool to generate initial project tracking documents: a `goal-manifest.md` and a `changelog.md`. This document defines the "What" and "Why" of these capabilities, strictly adhering to Level 1 requirements.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

* **Primary Goal:** To validate LangGraph's capability to orchestrate a sequence of `aider`-driven tasks for initial document generation, serving as a foundational experiment for more complex workflows.
* **Objective 1:** Demonstrate LangGraph orchestrating `aider` to generate an initial `goal-manifest.md` file based on a provided task description and a target format.
* **Objective 2:** Demonstrate LangGraph orchestrating `aider` to subsequently generate a `changelog.md` file, with an initial entry detailing the creation of the `goal-manifest.md`.
* **Objective 3:** Ensure the process provides clear observability through console output and dedicated observability solution.
* **Objective 4 (User Learning):** Provide hands-on experience with LangGraph for sequencing, state management between `aider`-driven steps, and basic error handling from `aider` calls.

## 3. Target Audience / User Personas

* **Primary User:** The developer initiating the PoC script, providing the initial configuration and `task-description.md`, and observing the system's output (console, generated files, observability system) to validate the successful orchestration.

## 4. Functional Requirements

This initial phase of PoC7 involves a LangGraph-orchestrated workflow comprising at least two primary functional steps, triggered by the developer.

### FR-PoC7-001: Process Initiation & Input

* **Trigger:** The developer initiates the process by running a Python script using `uv` (e.g., `uv run poc7_script.py`).
* **Input Preconditions:**
    * A configuration file must exist and specify the path to the target "goal folder."
    * The specified goal folder must exist.
    * The goal folder must contain a `task-description.md` file outlining the objective.
    * Sample documents or format definitions will guide the expected structure of the `goal-manifest.md` and `changelog.md`.

### FR-PoC7-002: `aider`-driven `goal-manifest.md` Generation

* **Description:** The system, orchestrated by LangGraph, will use `aider` to generate the initial `goal-manifest.md` file.
* **Process (Level 1 - Observable):**
    1.  LangGraph initiates the first primary step.
    2.  The system provides `aider` with the necessary context, including the content of `task-description.md` and the format template file.
    3.  `aider` processes this input and generates the `goal-manifest.md` file within the specified goal folder.
* **Output:** A `goal-manifest.md` file created in the goal folder.

### FR-PoC7-003: `aider`-driven `changelog.md` Creation & Initial Entry

* **Description:** Following previous step, the system, orchestrated by LangGraph, will use `aider` to create the `changelog.md` file and add its first entry.
* **Process (Level 1 - Observable):**
    1.  LangGraph initiates the second primary step, potentially using state/context from the previous step (e.g., confirmation of manifest creation, Goal ID).
    2.  The system provides `aider` with the necessary context and guidance towards the target changelog format to create an entry detailing the `goal-manifest.md` creation.
    3.  `aider` processes this input and generates/updates the `changelog.md` file in the goal folder with the initial entry.
* **Output:** A `changelog.md` file created/updated in the goal folder containing an initial entry about the manifest creation (including a timestamp and relevant details).

### FR-PoC7-004: Error Handling (General)

* **Description:** The system must handle typical, high-level errors gracefully during its operation.
* **Observable Behavior:** If a significant error occurs (e.g., missing `task-description.md`, `aider` execution fails catastrophically, file system writing issues), the process should stop and provide a clear error message to the user (e.g., via console output and observability system). (Detailed error handling for specific edge cases is out of scope for this initial prototype).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-PoC7-001: Idempotency:** If the PoC is run multiple times with the same initial `task-description.md` and the output files (`goal-manifest.md`, `changelog.md`) do not yet exist or are in an initial state, the outcome should consistently be the same set of correctly generated initial documents.
* **NFR-PoC7-002: Correctness:** The content of `goal-manifest.md` and `changelog.md` as generated by `aider` (and orchestrated by LangGraph) must accurately reflect the core information from the input `task-description.md` and adhere to the structural guidelines provided by the sample/format documents.
* **NFR-PoC7-003: Traceability & Observability:**
    * The system must stream `aider`'s real-time operational output (or a significant summary) to the console during execution.
    * The system must allow for visibility into high level workflow steps and then able to drill down into the specific logs of each step
* **NFR-PoC7-004: Modularity (LangGraph Design Goal):** The internal LangGraph design should aim for the `goal-manifest.md` creation process and the `changelog.md` creation process to be implemented as distinct, logically separated components/nodes within the graph. This is to support understandability and potential future reuse or extension. Ideally usage of aider should be implemented in a modular way as well.

## 6. Constraints

* **C-PoC7-001: Must use LangGraph:** LangGraph must be the primary orchestrator for the defined workflow.
* **C-PoC7-002: Must use `aider` for Document Generation:** The `aider` tool must be used for the generation and initial content population of both the `goal-manifest.md` and `changelog.md` files.
* **C-PoC7-003: `uv` for Execution Environment:** The PoC will be run as a Python script within an environment managed by `uv`.

## 7. Data Requirements (Level 1)

* **Input Data:**
    * Path to the target "goal folder" (read from a configuration file).
    * `task-description.md` file located within the goal folder.
    * Sample/template documents guiding the structure of `goal-manifest.md` and `changelog.md`.
* **Output Data:**
    * `goal-manifest.md` file created in the goal folder.
    * `changelog.md` file created in the goal folder with at least one initial entry.
    * Real-time workflow and `aider` output streamed to the console.
    * Observability into high level workflow steps and then able to drill down into the specific logs of each step
    * Console messages indicating overall success or failure of the PoC execution.

## 8. Success Metrics (Initial Phase)

* Successful creation of `goal-manifest.md` in the specified goal folder, with content that reflects the `task-description.md` and aligns with the provided sample/template, generated via `aider`.
* Successful creation of `changelog.md` in the specified goal folder, with an initial entry correctly detailing the manifest creation (including timestamp, relevant details), generated via `aider`.
* `aider` output is successfully streamed to the console during its operation.
* Both high-level and detailed logs are accessible for observability.
* The system correctly reads the goal folder path from a configuration file.
* The process handles basic error conditions (e.g., missing input file) by reporting an error.
* The LangGraph orchestration successfully sequences the `aider`-driven steps and manages necessary context between them.

## Technical Considerations & Exploration Ideas (Supplemental)

* **`aider` Interaction Style:** The current requirement is for the system to provide `aider` with "high level directions" (e.g., the `task-description.md` and a sample/template) and expect `aider` to infer and generate the documents based off of their templates.
* **Advanced Log Viewing/Interaction:** For future development or enhanced usability, explore existing open-source or commercial tools/libraries that could provide a more interactive way to view the generated log files. Desirable features might include:
    * A frontend interface.
    * The ability to easily navigate between high-level log entries and their corresponding detailed log segments.
    * Filtering, searching, and structured viewing capabilities.
* **LangGraph Node Granularity:** While the L1 PRD focuses on two primary functional outcomes, the LangGraph implementation might benefit from additional nodes for setup (e.g., reading config, validating inputs), error handling, or completion steps for better internal organization and state management.
