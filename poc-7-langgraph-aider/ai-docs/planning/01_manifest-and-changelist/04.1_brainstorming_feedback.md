**Summary of Changes from Original Brainstorming Approach 1**

The core concept of using LangGraph for a "Direct Sequential Workflow" as outlined in the original Brainstorming Approach 1 remains the foundation for PoC7. However, several significant refinements and structural changes have been incorporated based on our discussions and best practices:

1.  **Introduction of `AiderService`:**
    * **Original:** `aider` CLI interactions (subprocess calls) were conceptualized as happening directly *within* the LangGraph nodes (`generate_manifest_node`, `generate_changelog_node`).
    * **Current:** A dedicated `AiderService` class has been introduced. This service encapsulates all `aider` CLI command construction, execution, and output/error capturing. LangGraph nodes will now call methods on this service.

2.  **Dependency Injection for Services & Config:**
    * **Original:** While not explicitly detailed, the mechanism for nodes to access `aider` logic or shared config was less defined.
    * **Current:** The `AiderService` instance and an `AppConfig` instance (holding static configurations) will be injected into LangGraph nodes via LangGraph's `RunnableConfig` (specifically, its `configurable` dictionary). This adheres to best practices for keeping the `WorkflowState` lean.

3.  **Formalized `AppConfig`:**
    * **Original:** Mentioned a `config_path` in the state.
    * **Current:** A dedicated `AppConfig` (Pydantic `BaseModel`) will hold all static configurations (base paths, template paths, filenames, log settings, `aider` defaults). This is loaded once and injected via `RunnableConfig`.

4.  Logging change - for logging and observation, have two logs that are outputted - one high level, one detailed each with timestamps

5.  **Modular File Structure & Naming:**
    * **Original:** Less emphasis on specific file/folder structure in the brainstorming.
    * **Current:** A clear package structure, with an aim for smaller, more focused Python files (ideally <= 200 lines).
