# Technical Architecture: PoC7 - LangGraph Orchestration for Initial Document Generation

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-05-09 (Revised)
**Project Name:** PoC7 - LangGraph Orchestration for Initial Document Generation

## 1. Overview

This document details the technical architecture for Proof-of-Concept (PoC) 7. The project's primary goal is to validate LangGraph's effectiveness in orchestrating a stateful, multi-step workflow. This PoC specifically focuses on LangGraph orchestrating the `aider` tool for the initial generation of a `goal-manifest.md` and the recording of this event in a `changelog.md`. This serves as a foundational step for the broader "Sleepy Dev Team" project. This architecture prioritizes demonstrating core orchestration mechanics and `aider` integration over exhaustive, deep error recovery, user interface considerations, or advanced file content validation for this PoC phase.

The chosen architecture is a **Direct Sequential Workflow** leveraging LangGraph. Key aspects of this architecture include:
* Service-oriented interactions for external tools: A dedicated `AiderService` encapsulates `aider` CLI interactions for document generation, and a `ChangelogService` (also utilizing `aider` for this PoC) handles structured updates to the `changelog.md`.
* A formalized `AppConfig` Pydantic model for static configurations.
* Dependency injection of services and configurations into LangGraph nodes via `RunnableConfig`.
* A dual-logging mechanism (`overview.log` and `detailed.log`) with specified timestamp formats.
* Adherence to a modular Python file structure.

The main objectives are to demonstrate `aider` orchestration for document creation and changelog updates, ensure clear observability, and provide insights into LangGraph's capabilities for sequencing, state management, and basic error handling, all within a `uv`-managed Python environment.

## 3. Technology Stack

The following technologies are chosen for the development and execution of this PoC:

* **Primary Language:**
    * **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher (as indicated in `uv-project-setup.md` and aligning with LangGraph best practices).
* **Orchestration Framework:**
    * **LangGraph:** The core Python library for building the stateful, multi-step workflow.
* **Core Python Libraries:**
    * **Pydantic:** Utilized for defining the `AppConfig` data model.
    * **Python `subprocess` module:** Employed by `AiderService` and `ChangelogService` to interact with `aider`.
    * **Python `logging` module:** Standard library module for the `Logging System`.
    * **Python `typing` module:** Used for type hints, including `TypedDict` for `WorkflowState`.
    * **Python `datetime` module:** Used for generating timestamps for changelog entries.
* **External Tools & Services (CLI-based):**
    * **`aider`:** AI-powered tool used as a service by `AiderService` and `ChangelogService`.
    * **`uv`:** Python packaging tool for environment management and script execution.
* **Development & Version Control:**
    * **Git:** For source code version control.
