# Feature List (for PoC7 - Initial Phase)

This initial phase of Proof of Concept 7 will demonstrate the following core capabilities, which are integral to validating LangGraph for the "Sleepy Dev Team" project:

* **Goal Manifest Scaffolding:**
    * The system initiates its workflow under the **precondition** that a dedicated goal folder (e.g., for a "Small Tweak" task) already exists and contains a `task-description.md` file outlining the specific objective.
    * Given this precondition, the system will create a new Goal Manifest file within the designated folder. This manifest will be populated based on the information in the `task-description.md` and will consistently adhere to the sample manifest provided.
    * The purpose of this capability is to demonstrate the system's ability to correctly interpret an initial task and lay down the structured tracking document (the Goal Manifest) that "Sleepy Dev Team" will use.

* **Initial Changelog Creation and Entry:**
    * Contemporaneously with the Goal Manifest scaffolding, the system will create a persistent changelog file.
    * The very first entry in this changelog will record the event of the Goal Manifest's creation, including a timestamp and relevant details (e.g., the goal title or task ID).
    * This functionality is included to establish the mechanism for transparent and auditable history from the very beginning of a task's lifecycle within the "Sleepy Dev Team" orchestrator.
    * The format will be provided in a sample changelog file.
