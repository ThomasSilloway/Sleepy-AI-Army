Okay I like option 1 but with some changes.

- We already have the workflow state populated, so we don't need the `prepare_tweak_execution_node`
- We can skip right to the execute one and pass in the whole goal manifest file as a readme file, this file already has the task description in it. Actually maybe we should just pass the task-description.md file in 
   - I'm not sure how we'll be able to get the tweak_commit_hash - maybe to future proof this, it should actually be an array.  I'm not sure the aider output is structured enough to be able to parse out a commit hash from it?  I'm also not sure how we can get a good summary of what aider actually did. Can you google search to see if there's any structured output we can get from aider from the aider docs?  What other ideas do you have for this?  Make sure to ground with search bc the aider docs have newer information than what you've been trained on
   - This one will also update the changelog just like the goal manifest creation node does
- We also don't need the `prepare_manfiest-update_node` 
- Let's just call the next node `update_goal_manifest`
  - This one will also update the changelog just like the goal manifest creation node does
