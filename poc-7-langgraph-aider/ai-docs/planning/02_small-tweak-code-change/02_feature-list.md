# Feature List (for PoC7 - Phase 2: Automated Task Execution)

This second phase of Proof of Concept 7 will demonstrate the system's ability to automatically carry out a defined small task. This builds upon the initial record-keeping capabilities and is key to showing how the system can manage and execute automated development work.

* **Automated Task Performance:**
    * **Precondition:** The system has already started, initial records about the goal are in place, and a clear description of a specific, simple task is available.
    * The system will read and understand the defined small task.
    * It will then use an integrated AI-assisted tool to automatically perform the required modification (e.g., making a minor change to a project file).
    * If the task is completed successfully, the changes will be saved and versioned.
    * **Purpose:** To show the system can take a defined task, use AI tools to execute it, and properly save the results.

* **Updating the Central Goal Record After Task Execution:**
    * After the system attempts to perform the small task, the main tracking document for the goal will be automatically updated.
    * This update will reflect the outcome of the task, such as whether it was completed successfully or if issues were encountered.
    * It will also include details about what was changed and any relevant versioning information.
    * **Purpose:** To demonstrate that the system keeps its central record of the goal's progress and status accurate and up-to-date following automated actions.

Successfully implementing these features will validate the core PoC7 vision of orchestrating automated tasks, and managing the progress of these tasks through a central record
