# 1. Vision Statement (for PoC7)

The vision for PoC7 is to prove the viability and effectiveness of LangGraph as a foundational technology for the "Sleepy Dev Team" orchestrator. This PoC aims to demonstrate LangGraph's ability to manage stateful, multi-step workflows involving:

- The dynamic creation and management of a detailed Goal Manifest to track incremental progress across multiple development tasks.
- The orchestration of "Small Tweak" automated tasks (e.g., code documentation, minor refactoring), which represent logical steps within larger "Sleepy Dev Team" tasks. This includes exploring how LangGraph can manage tasks that may eventually involve tools like aider.
- The meticulous maintenance of a comprehensive changelog, providing transparency into the automated operations.

Successfully demonstrating these capabilities in PoC7 will validate key architectural assumptions for "Sleepy Dev Team" and provide a robust building block for its development.

# 2. Why This PoC? (Alignment with "Sleepy Dev Team")

The "Sleepy Dev Team" project envisions an AI orchestrator that makes incremental progress on various development tasks. This requires a sophisticated system for:

- State Management: Tracking the status of multiple tasks, their sub-steps, generated artifacts, and AI-user interactions.
- Workflow Orchestration: Defining how tasks are broken down, which AI capabilities or tools (like aider) are invoked for each step, and how user feedback is incorporated.
- Incremental Progress: Advancing tasks one logical step at a time and clearly recording this progress.

PoC7 is being built to de-risk and validate the use of LangGraph for these core requirements before fully integrating all complex AI tools and the full scope of "Sleepy Dev Team" tasks. Specifically, PoC7 will answer:

- Can LangGraph effectively manage the detailed state represented in the proposed Goal Manifest?
- Can LangGraph orchestrate a sequence of operations including manifest updates, task selection, execution of a simplified "Small Tweak" task, and changelogging in a resilient manner?
- Are LangGraph's conditional logic and state update mechanisms suitable for the kind of dynamic, multi-step task processing "Sleepy Dev Team" needs?
- How well can error handling patterns (inspired by PoC6) be implemented within a LangGraph architecture?

This PoC focuses on the workflow mechanics using LangGraph, laying the groundwork for later integration of more complex AI capabilities (like advanced aider integration for various coding tasks, Q&A generation, etc.) as outlined in the "Sleepy Dev Team" goals.
