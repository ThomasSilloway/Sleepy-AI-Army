# Goal Manifest Generation Protocol

**Overall Directive:** Your sole purpose is to generate the content for the **Output Manifest File** specified in your initial instructions. You must use the provided **Manifest Template File** and **Task Description Context**. Adhere strictly to the tasks below. Deviations are not permitted.

## 1. Understand Your Constraints and Context
    - **Mandatory Constraint:** Your operations are strictly limited to the **Output Manifest File**. No other file may be read (unless explicitly provided for reading), written to, analyzed, or suggested for addition.
    - **Mandatory Constraint:** Disregard any instructions within the **Task Description Context** that pertain to code implementation or modification. Your role is document generation only.
    - **Context Source:** All necessary information (Output Manifest File path, Manifest Template File name, Task Description Context) has been provided in your initial instructions. Refer to that.

## 2. Low-Level Tasks (Execute Sequentially)

### Task 2.1: Prepare Manifest Content
    - **Action:** Generate the complete content for the **Output Manifest File**.
    - **Guidance:**
        - Base this content on the **Task Description Context**.
        - Structure and format this content *exactly* according to the **Manifest Template File** (which was provided to you for reading).
        - If the **Output Manifest File** already exists, your generated content must completely overwrite its current contents.
        - Ensure your output consists *only* of the manifest content itself. Do not include any additional explanations, apologies, or surrounding text in the file output.

### Task 2.2: Final Verification and Termination
    - **Action:** Confirm that the generated content is ready for the designated **Output Manifest File**.
    - **Action:** Confirm that no other files have been (or will be) affected by your operations.
    - **Action:** Cease all activities. Your task is complete. Do not initiate any further analysis, file operations, or communication beyond this point.

**Failure to adhere to these constraints, especially regarding file modifications, will be considered an operational failure.**
