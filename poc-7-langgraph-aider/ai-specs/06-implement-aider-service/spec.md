# Features: Implement AiderService for CLI Interaction

> Given the Objective, implement every detail of every task, using the referenced architectural documents as the primary guide for implementation specifics.

## Objectives

- Implement the `AiderService` to manage interactions with the `aider` CLI tool, enabling command construction and execution.
- Ensure the service can execute `aider` commands as subprocesses.
- Implement capabilities for real-time streaming of `aider`'s `stdout`/`stderr`.
- Ensure the service accurately captures and returns `aider`'s exit status.

## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish. Implement the described functionality, using standard Python features, error handling, and logging as appropriate.

### Task 1: Implement Core `aider` Subprocess Execution Logic
```
- UPDATE `poc-7-langgraph-aider\src\services\aider_service.py`:
    - Enhance the `execute` method to robustly run `aider` as a subprocess. This includes constructing the command from provided arguments and managing the lifecycle of the subprocess.
```

### Task 2: Implement `aider` Output Streaming
```
- UPDATE `poc-7-langgraph-aider\src\services\aider_service.py`:
    - Integrate functionality within the `execute` method to capture and stream `aider`'s `stdout` and `stderr` in real-time using the logger in `poc-7-langgraph-aider\src\utils\logging_setup.py`
    - Ensure outputs are directed to the console (for immediate visibility) for now. Do not implement the logging to file yet.
```

### Task 3: Implement `aider` Exit Status Handling
```
- UPDATE `poc-7-langgraph-aider\src\services\aider_service.py`:
    - Modify the `execute` method to accurately capture the exit status from the `aider` subprocess.
    - Ensure this exit status is returned by the method to allow calling code to react to the outcome of the `aider` command.
```
