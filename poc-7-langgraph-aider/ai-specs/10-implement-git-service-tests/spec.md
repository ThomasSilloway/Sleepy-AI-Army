# Features: Implement GitService Test Suite

> Given the Objective, implement every detail of every task, using the referenced architectural documents as the primary guide for implementation specifics.

## Objectives

- Create a new test file for the `GitService` (`src/services/git_service.py`).
- Ensure the test file is structured similarly to `tests/test_changelog_service.py`, including setup for `AppConfig` and service instantiation.
- Implement functions that call the core functionalities of `GitService`:
    - `get_last_commit_hash()`
    - `get_last_commit_summary()`
    - `get_last_commit_file_stats()`
- Print the output of these functions to the console for manual verification.

## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish. Implement the described functionality, using standard Python features, error handling, and logging as appropriate.

### Task 1: Create Script Structure for `GitService` Execution
```
- CREATE poc-7-langgraph-aider\tests\test_git_service.py: Establish the basic structure for a Python script that will execute `GitService` methods. This includes:
    - Necessary imports (e.g., `logging`, `os`, `sys`, `AppConfig`, `GitService`, `setup_logging`).
    - Loading `AppConfig` from `config.yml`.
    - Setting up logging using `setup_logging`.
    - Instantiating `GitService`, ensuring it's initialized with the `repo_path` derived from `AppConfig` (e.g., `app_config.goal_root_path`).
    - Include a main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to orchestrate the setup and function calls.
    - The structure should generally follow the setup pattern seen in `tests/test_changelog_service.py` for consistency in configuration and service instantiation.
```

### Task 2: Implement Functions to Execute and Print `GitService` Method Outputs
```
- UPDATE poc-7-langgraph-aider\tests\test_git_service.py:
    - Define a primary function (e.g., `run_git_service_tests` or `execute_git_service_methods`) that takes the instantiated `AppConfig` and `GitService` as arguments.
    - Within this function, make sequential calls to the following `GitService` methods:
        - `git_service.get_last_commit_hash()`
        - `git_service.get_last_commit_summary()`
        - `git_service.get_last_commit_file_stats()`
    - For each method call:
        - Capture the returned value.
        - Print a descriptive message to the console indicating which method was called.
        - Print the captured return value to the console.
        - Implement basic error handling (e.g., try-except blocks) around these calls to catch and log potential exceptions (like `ValueError` from `GitService` initialization if the path is not a repo, or `subprocess.CalledProcessError`), ensuring the script can report issues gracefully.
    - Ensure the main execution block calls this primary function.
    - Log informational messages (using `logger.overview` or `logger.info`) at the start and end of the script execution and around major steps, similar to `test_changelog_service.py`.
```
