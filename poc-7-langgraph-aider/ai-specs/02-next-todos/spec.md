# Features: Implement Core Workflow Initialization and Input Validation Logic

> Given the Objective, implement every detail of every task, using the referenced architectural documents as the primary guide for implementation specifics.

## Objectives

- Integrate `AppConfig` loading into the main application entry point (`src/main.py`) using `omegaconf`, and update project dependencies.
- Implement the primary responsibilities of the `initialize_workflow_node` as defined in the technical architecture (`ai-docs/planning/06_2-tech_architecture-flow.md`, Flow 1, Step 2), focusing on `AppConfig` retrieval, path setup/validation, and initial logging.

## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish. Implement the described functionality, using standard Python features, error handling, and logging as appropriate.

### Task 1: Integrate AppConfig Loading and Update Dependencies
```
- UPDATE `poc-7-langgraph-aider\src\main.py`:
    - Define and implement a function responsible for loading the application configuration from `config.yml` (default path).
        - This function should use the `omegaconf` library to load the YAML content.
        - It must instantiate an `AppConfig` object (from `src.config`) with the loaded data.
        - Incorporate error handling for scenarios such as the configuration file not being found or being malformed, raising appropriate exceptions.
    - Invoke this configuration loading function within the `main()` method to obtain the `app_config` instance.
    - Log the outcome of the configuration loading process (success or specific errors).
    - Remove the `# TODO: Load AppConfig` placeholder comment.

- UPDATE `poc-7-langgraph-aider\pyproject.toml`:
    - Ensure `omegaconf` is added as a dependency under the `[project.dependencies]` section.
```

### Task 2: Implement Core Logic for `initialize_workflow_node`
```
- UPDATE `poc-7-langgraph-aider\src\nodes\initialization.py`:
    - Implement the `initialize_workflow_node` function to align with its documented role in "Flow 1: Successful Document Generation & Changelog Update", Step 2, of `ai-docs/planning/06_2-tech_architecture-flow.md`.
    - **Key functional requirements for the node:**
        - AppConfig should be supplied via dependency injection 
        - Set the `current_step_name` in `WorkflowState`.
        - Invoke `setup_logging()` (from `src.utils.logging_setup`) for initial logger configuration.
        - Log the commencement of the workflow initialization.
        - Validate the existence and directory status of `goal_root_path` and `workspace_root_path` from `AppConfig`. On failure, set `state['error_message']`, log the specific path error, and return.
        - Resolve and store all critical absolute file and directory paths (derived from `AppConfig`, including paths for task description, templates, outputs, and the log subdirectory) into the `WorkflowState`.
        - Ensure the designated log output subdirectory exists, creating it if it doesn't. Store the resolved absolute paths for `overview.log` and `detailed.log` in `WorkflowState` (e.g., `state['overview_log_file_path']`) for potential use by an enhanced `setup_logging` mechanism later.
        - Update `state['last_event_summary']` upon successful completion.
        - Log the overall success or failure of this initialization step.
    - Replace the existing placeholder comment `# TODO: Implement node logic` and the basic `print` statement with the new logic and appropriate Python `logging` calls.
