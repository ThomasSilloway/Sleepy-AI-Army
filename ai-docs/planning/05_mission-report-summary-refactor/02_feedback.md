We completed two missions and made these updates to further the goal:

 - Added method `get_diff_for_commit` to `git_service.py`
 - Added `questions_asked` field to `AiderRunSummary` model in `aider_summary.py`
 - Updated `get_system_prompt` function in `prompts.py` to include '## Questions Asked' section
