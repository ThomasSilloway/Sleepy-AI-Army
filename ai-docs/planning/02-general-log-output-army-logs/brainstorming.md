## Conventional Solutions

1.  **Direct `stdout`/`stderr` Logging by `army-general`:**
    *   **Description:** Modify `army-general`'s `_run_secretary` and `_run_army_man` functions. After `subprocess.run()`, if new config flags are enabled, take the `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` and log them line-by-line using `army-general`'s logger. Prepend lines with a tag like `[Secretary STDOUT]` or `[ArmyMan STDERR]` for clarity.
    *   **How it addresses the problem:** Directly pipes the raw output from child processes into the parent's logging stream. Good for capturing all output, especially if child process logging fails.

2.  **Shared Logging Configuration/Stream:**
    *   **Description:** (More complex) Modify all three projects to optionally use a shared logging setup. This could involve passing a logging handler or a queue from `army-general` to the child processes (e.g., via environment variables or a temporary config file). Child processes would then add this handler to their own logging setup.
    *   **How it addresses the problem:** Integrates logging at a deeper level. Allows child processes to log directly into the parent's designated streams, potentially with more structure if the child's logger is working.

3.  **Centralized Logging Service (e.g., ELK, Loki, Seq):**
    *   **Description:** Configure all three applications to send logs to a dedicated, external logging server/service. `army-general` wouldn't directly capture output, but all logs would be viewable and searchable in one place.
    *   **How it addresses the problem:** Robust, scalable solution for managing logs from multiple processes/services. Provides advanced searching and filtering.

## Radically Different Approaches

1.  **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) for Structured Log Events:**
    *   **Description:** Instead of just text logs, child processes use an IPC mechanism (e.g., sockets, message queues like ZeroMQ or RabbitMQ, or even a simple file-based queue) to send structured log *events* (e.g., JSON objects with timestamp, level, message, context) to `army-general`. `army-general` would have a listener to receive these events and log them.
    *   **How it addresses the problem:** Provides more reliable and structured information than raw text. Allows for more intelligent filtering and processing by `army-general`. Less prone to issues if `stdout/stderr` are producing non-log related output.

2.  **"Sidecar" Log Aggregator per Subprocess:**
    *   **Description:** When `army-general` starts `secretary` or `army-man`, it also starts a very lightweight "sidecar" process alongside each. This sidecar's only job is to tail the log files of its associated process (secretary or army-man) in real-time and forward new log entries to `army-general`'s main log file or a designated port on `army-general`. The child processes (`secretary`, `army-man`) would continue to log to their own files as they do now.
    *   **How it addresses the problem:** Decouples log forwarding from the main application logic of both parent and child. Child processes don't need modification. `army-general` gets near real-time updates without directly managing child process `stdout/stderr` streams. This assumes child processes *can* log to their own files successfully.
