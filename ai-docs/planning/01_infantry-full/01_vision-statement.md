The Infantry Agent will be the cornerstone of tactical execution within Sleepy AI Army, renowned for its unwavering reliability and surgical precision in transforming clearly defined Missions into production-quality code. Operating with disciplined autonomy, it will flawlessly execute its orders based solely on the provided intelligence and context, consistently delivering clean, effective, and seamlessly integrated software changes directly into the development workflow.

Our primary goal is to evolve Sleepy AI Army from its current v0.1 state by replacing the Army Man (capable of small, single-file tweaks) with a significantly more robust and capable Infantry Agent.

This new Infantry Agent will be a cornerstone of the "Operation: Next Level" strategy. It's envisioned as a reliable and precise code execution unit that operates on "sealed orders" â€“ meticulously executing well-defined, human-approved Missions (derived either from simple backlog tasks or from complex Battlefield plans approved by the user). It will autonomously handle Git operations (branching, committing), leverage tools like Aider with LLMs, and aim to produce production-quality code, all based strictly on the pre-defined context within its mission brief without requiring further human interaction during its run.
